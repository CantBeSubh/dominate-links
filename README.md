# Project Name

## Introduction
Briefly introduce your project here. You can describe what your project does and the main features it offers.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A Clerk account (for handling authentication and user management)

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
To get started with this project, first clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
cd [project-directory]
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Navigate into the project directory and install the required packages:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Step 3: Setup the Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of your project and add the following environment variables:
```plaintext
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
```

### Step 4: Setup the Database
Ensure your database is configured according to the settings in your `prisma/schema.prisma` file. Run the following command to update your database schema:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### Step 5: Start the Application
You can now start the development server by running:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### Step 6: Setup the Clerk Webhook
For local development and testing of Clerk webhooks, you can use tools like ngrok:
1. Install ngrok and start it on your local machine to expose your local server:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```
2. Copy the HTTPS forwarding address provided by ngrok and use it to configure the webhook URL in your Clerk dashboard.
